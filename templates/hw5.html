            <h3>Here are the summary the feedback/comments/insights we received:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The app panel design is easy to understand and supports other settings such as foreign exchange and languages. However, there are suggestions to revise the market plots and add a button to guide users from the exchange rate conversion to the actual exchange.</li>
                <li>The system has a cool feature of displaying a money flow table, but there are some areas for improvement such as adding prompts for personal information format, making the trade button more visible, and adding a button on the exchange page. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide notifications to users after completing a transaction.</li>
